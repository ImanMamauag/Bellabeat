<h1>Google Analytics Capstone Project – Bellabeat </h1>

<p align = 'justify'>Bellabeat provides a suite of wellness products designed for women, tracking activity, sleep, and stress, all integrated with the Bellabeat app. This project analyzed data from 30 eligible Fitbit users (crowdsourced in 2016) to support strategic business decisions.
The objective was to identify consumer trends and behaviors in the smart device market and generate actionable insights to strengthen the positioning of Bellabeat’s health-focused smart products—enhancing user engagement, increasing product value, and boosting market competitiveness.
Key tools used in the project included Excel for data cleaning, SQL (SQL Server) for data exploration, Tableau for data visualization, and PowerPoint for presenting findings.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p align = 'justify'>
<li>To understand broader consumer trends and behaviors in the smart device market.</li>

<h2 id="insights">Key Consumer Insights</h2>
<h3><p>1. High Sedentary Behavior: Majority of users spend the day inactive; "very active" minutes are consistently low.</h3>

<li>Sleep is most affected by sedentary behavior, not activity levels.</li>
<br>
<ul>This visualization compares how different types of physical activity (and inactivity) relate to average sleep duration.</ul>

</br>
<li> Sedentary Time Has the Strongest Relationship with Sleep - and It's Negative.</li>
<li> Light, Fair, and Active Physical Activities Show No Strong Correlation.</li>

<h4>Sleep duration appears to be more negatively impacted by how sedentary you are, rather than improved by how active you are.</h4>
<ul>Cutting down sitting time may help more with sleep than just trying to exercise more.</ul>
<ul></ul>


<h3>2. Suboptimal Step Counts: Most users fall short of the WHO’s recommended 10,000 daily steps.</h3>

<h3>3. Sleep vs. Sedentary Correlation: Poor sleep is more strongly linked to high sedentary time than low activity levels.</h3>

<h3>4. Weekday Trends: Activity levels are generally stable, with slight midweek dips (notably on Tuesday).</h3>

<h3>5. Calories Burned = Steps Taken: Step count is the most consistent predictor of energy expenditure.</h3>

<br>

<h2 id="recommendations">Strategic Recommendations</h2>

<h3><p>1. Product Engagement & Feature Innovation</h3>

<li><b>Inactivity Alerts:</b> Smart prompts to reduce sedentary time (e.g., stretch, short walks).</li>

<li><b>Tiered Step Goals:</b> Daily micro-goals for gradual progress toward 10,000 steps.</li>

<li><b>Sleep-Activity Feedback Loops:</b> Personalized insights showing how movement affects rest.</li>


<h3>2. User Motivation & Retention</h3>

<li><b>Gamified Weekly Challenges:</b> Encourage consistency and recovery from low-activity days.</li>

<li><b>Social & Community Features:</b> Peer comparisons, step leaderboards, or team challenges.</li>


<h3>3. Marketing & Positioning Strategy</h3>

<li>Position the device as a <i>“Daily Wellness Companion”</i> focused on improving sleep, movement, and recovery—not just fitness.</li>

<li>Use data-driven messaging such as <i>“Stand more. Sleep better.”</i> or <i>“Wellness in every step.”</i></li>
